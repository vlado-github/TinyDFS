A learning project.
Building a simple distributed file system from ground up.

- The file system should have the equivalent of the open, close, read and write calls. 
- The file data should be cooperatively cached and kept in more than one node. 
- Implements a consistency policy for reads and writes. 
- Tackless the problem of how keeping data in more than one node helps to provide fault tolerance. 

## Plans

This project needs to provide evaluation results in terms of performance improvement due to caching as well as the improved fault tolerance due to multi-node caching.
